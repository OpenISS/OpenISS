* Kelly Herstine Documentation:
  - The project as is, is not much from when our team first started the project. There were a lot of ups and downs while
reating different aspects of this project. In the end, I think that it all came down to time. We were all very busy with
this class as well as two other classes and I think that a lot of us got very overwhelmed and we werent able to complete
the project to the standard of what the class wanted. I tried to help out with as much as I could. I originally created 
different C files for the Protonect files but then ran into the issue that I then needed to create C files for the libfreenect 
files too. I also tried to get the server logging to work. I looked at the files that there were for the libfreenect 2 folder
and found some logging examples. I then tried to create my own logging class which also didnt work as expected. Karim and I decided
to try and work in some of the already made server files which then somewhat worked.

* Cameron Belcher Documentation:
   - We didnt get very far into the project. I know there was a couple of times where a student and I would spend a long amount
of time in the labs trying to figure out what to do. We would end up looking into a solution on the internet and then might
actually break the system all together. Then we would spend more time trying to reverse the effect. I did find accomplishment
in getting the Kinnects to work on the computers after we got the NVIDIA drivers updated. I think this project would've
been better if it were over the entire semester, since I have two other classes that also require a lot of my time. In the
end I started to try to do some things with sockets for the project as well as wrap the C++ files into C, but the Socket made
an endless loop of messages that took a while to fix and I didn't know too well how to wrap the c++ files apparently. I
ended up taking a more supportive role in the project, where I would assist when needed.

* Karim Elzanaty Documentation:
   - The project has not progressed very much since it began. Most likely due to our limited knowledge of what to do, and how. 
Most of what I did was attempt to convert c++ files to c, make sure installs were all installed, and attempt to get things
to actually run. The biggest roadblock was the complexity of the codebase, and our limited knowledge of c. I'm unsure if we
were expected to know more about c++ to c conversions, or if a lot of what we did just wasn't necessary. I spent far too 
much time simply trying to understand what was happening in the scripts. I also didn't know how to test if what I had done 
even worked, past compilation. The last thing I did was attempt to create a way to log non-fatal errors and messages to a 
file. There was lots of sleep lost while pouring over file after file to try and figure out what was going on.

##Achievements##

* Kelly Herstine:
  - I was able to get Nvidia to download properly on the laptop and was able to run Protonect which would show where the Kinect was 
as well as what it was capturing. I was also able to start creating C files from the previous cpp files that were in the Protonect
and Libfreenect 2 files

* CameronBelcher:
  - I was able to get NVIDIA downloaded, The kinnect 360 and the kinnect One to work without crashing, assisted in wrapping C files

* Karim Elzanaty:
  - I got NVIDIA drivers installed, got one ogl example fully converted to c, and tried helping others also do so. I got a "log" system
to work properly, and would generally help others debug compiler errors. 

## Limitations ##

* Kelly Herstine:
  - As of right now, I was not able to get Protonect files converted to c. I was also not able to make the libfreenect 2 files converted to 
the C files

* Cameron Belcher:
  - Not a lot of knowledge on C in general

* Karim Elzanaty:
  - I don't understand c very well to know the differences between it and c++. I was unable to convert more files due to time limitations.

## Progress to date ##

* Kelly Herstine:
  - I think the most progress that I was able to do was to create the server logging with Karim as well as download Nvidia properly and 
get Protonect working when running.

* Cameron Belcher:
  - Kinnects working!!!

* Karim Elzanaty:
  - NVIDIA installed, one c++ file converted to c, and a "log" system with Kelly.

## Experience ##

* Kelly Herstine:
  - The experience of this project was one of the hardest that I think I have had to go through. I was expecting there to be work but I 
was not expecting the amount of work that we got. I think the main issue was that we had to not only learn C, but also apply it to 
a project that wasnt necessarily working completley (libfreenect). While I understand that we were able to continue working on the project
around this issue, I still found it somewhat annoying to have to deal with because there was a lot of trial and error and scrapping of files
that we made. I also think the worry of failing this class was at the back of my mind the entire time becuase I would try my hardest on
different parts of the project as well as put many hours into it, but I would still not have anything to show and I think thats what worries me the most.

* Cameron Belcher:
  - I didnt want to waste valuable time i could put into a project that I knew what I was doing, so unless I had free time I would 
procrastinate on the project to the last two days it was due. I am worried of failing the class, but I know I spent my resources correctly. 

* Karim Elzanaty:
  - This class was extremely difficult, but not because of the workload. There was much we just didn't understand, and the final project had much we just 
hadn't practiced. The few assignments before the final were small and focused, and the last one was a huge pace shift. I have a difficult time with things
I don't understand, and this class had a lot of that. Lots of anxiety worrying about failing because I just couldn't wrap my head around all the information.

## Future Work ##

* Kelly Herstine:
  - libfreenect still needs to be fixed. There are different parts of this project that will still need to be completed such as the part where there are
cpp files that will need to be changed to c.

* Cameron Belcher:
  - The C++ files needed to be files needed to be wrapped and we were not fully done with communication between computers

* Karim Elzanaty:
  - Sending and recieving messages still doesn't work, and the conversion of many c++ files to c isn't complete. The wrappers themselves aren't made either.
