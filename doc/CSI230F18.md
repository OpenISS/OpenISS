Work Done
=========
+ Jacob
    + Started working through the scripts called by the makefile and finding solutions.
    + Added Travis to my fork
    + Finished working through OFX build scripts, started looking at samples.
    + Started work on converting .hpp files to .h files with Cameron
    + Finished building Open Frameworks
    + Tried several ways to build the Open Frameworks examples.
        + Downloaded multiple automated builder versions from their site following the readme 
        + Directly cloned the repo and tried to do the same.
    + Attempted C wrapper for OISkeleton
        + Doesn’t normally compile, C wrapper has same error
    + Attempted C wrapper for OFXCpp
        + Missing header file, neither original nor wrapper compiles.
    + Compiled documentation and transfered to markdown
+ RJ 
    + RQ-SCRIPTS-DEPS-3
    + Assignment 4 requires the Make files to be updated more, found problems in the el7.sh
        + Doesn’t find ./dependencies/el7.sh.cache when it exists
        + Does this in libfreenect, libreenect2 and freenect depends
    + RQ-OPENNI2
        + Installed the OpenNI2, makefile had to rename the OpenNI 2.2 α because it didn’t compile that way. 
        + Had to install glibc.686
        + Had to install glut for dependency for SimpleRead 
            + Didn’t work, required libglut.so.3, when glut installed it didn’t install the required library
 
    + RQ-OGL 
        + OpenISS would either not recognize the kinect or recognize it and then tell me it was busy halfway through
        + Failed to claim camera interface: LIBUSB_ERROR_BUSY
        + Error: Invalid index [0]
        + Error: Kinect not connected?
        + Tried doing ps gx to find if the kinect was being used by something else but there was nothing. 
        + Can’t move forward with most of these assignments because of this not running
    + RQ-OSC 
        + Tried to get tinyosc functional. Tried adding a send function according to docs but it didn’t look like it was the right thing so I stopped trying with that. Mike took over and made progress
        + Issues with example issoscsender and issoscreceiver, default parameters for write message does not have a format so it will always error if you dont change the fourth parameter to a format option
        + Adding send always returns -1
    + OpenNI2/NiTE2 continued trying to work on it, realized I was working in x86_64 when I should have been using x64
        + Had an error everytime while running the output files 
            + DeviceOpen using default: no devices found
        + Tried to install OpenNI2 drivers in the libfreenect files but it didn’t work completely 
            + Had to change make file includes to add some libfreenect files
            + Stumped with ld -lfreenectstatic was not found
                + *Tried to figure this out until 430am*
            + Only documentation I found was that i could yum install it for fedora
+ Tommy 
    + Got the Makefile in /OpenISS/src/api/c/examples/fakenect to work
        + ‘make rungl’ work and ‘make runglpcl’ now work as intended
            + commands will only work if the user runs the following commands before hand
            > ldd freenect-glview  
            > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
            + it will run ‘rungl’ and ‘runglview’ using the ./TestRecording path
    + Tried to get the Messaging and Receiving to work
        + got RJ to help get to where he was with the sending and receiving and got to the point where one receiver terminal would be opened and one sender terminal would be opened afterwards. The sender terminal would say that it was sending messages, but the receiver definitely was not receiving messages. 
        + posted on canvas about the messaging and receiving and found out that the 
+ Mike
    + Downloaded a version of Doom Legacy, added IWAP files required for doom as well as installed SDL library/SDL mixer library. Have a compiled version of Doom that will run and have at the menu screen. Any proceeded gameplay would crash the current linux computer I was using so I didn’t restart the program but it works (sort of).
    + Downloaded a secondary batch of files from the Doom Legacy package that contains its main src files. Read through a majority and have documented most of the functions that I assume are HCI related. All are then zipped and placed into the project folder.
    + Went to Assignment 1 and attempted to build and compile the nethack program. Failed to do so as it had said it was missing libraries. There was also not enough documentation to explain how to properly compile it. I have created a text file and documented on all the HCI related files/function (files that I assume are HCI) and uploaded as a file onto google docs.
     + Looked at Tiny OSC and ran the test for the receiver and messenger, attempted to create the sender to send. Update: I have gotten sender to send. The issue is that listen and accept will only use SOCK_STREAM. There ore listen and accept will fail. If this is true, I might have to rewrite the entire code for sender and receiver. For the most part, sender seems to work as intended as its purpose is to send buffer. I feel that I might have overlooked a piece of code or something simalar.


+ Kelly
    + Started working on .Protonect file to convert to .c and .h. ~10 hours
        + Lost work due to the fact that it wasn’t supported in Gedit and didnt save
        + Began converting necessary files that were included in the Protonect file
        + This led to trying to create a .h file to frame_listener and libfreenect2. (Which was lost)
    + Attempted to get the ISS Driver to work 
        + Multiple errors in doing so, including the fact that it couldn't find the iss driver in the etc/ folder.
        + Tried to run different make commands from make file and ended up doing each step by step. 
            + Still didnt fix issue
+ Karim
    + Verified compilation of ogl example files 
    + Worked on converting ogl example3.cpp file to .c
        + Finished after multiple days of work. Continuous misunderstanding of the goal slowed down progress greatly
        + Created example3.c, .h, wrapper.cpp, and wrapper.h
        + Conversion ended up working just fine, makefile runs correctly
+ Cameron
    + Converted some cpp files inside of the ../../src/api/cpp folder to c files
        + Later learned that some of the files didnt have certain api that cpp had
    + Worked with Jacob to try and update the cpp files even more
    + BIG BREAK
        + Message from syslogd@203-12-l at Dec 10 23:20:46 ...
        + usbmuxd:[23:20:46.904][1] config_get_device_record: failed to read '/var/lib/lockdown/7e2583d2c2cfbe93c211537cf2642de38b1409d0.plist': No such file or directory
        + **I CANT DO ANYTHING MY CONSOLE IS IN PURGATORY**

Working Examples and Scripts
============================
See CSI230F18/errors.md for more detailed problems and solutions

    + Fixed by following https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/install-ffmpeg-centos-7/ to install requirements
+ linux/el6/install_dependencies.sh
    + No package rtaudio-devel available. Could not find one for Centos or Enterprise Linux 7

+ src/api/c/examples/ogl/Makefile
    + Works to compile and run tutorial 2 and 3

Non-working Examples and Scripts

    + el7.sh #cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE ..
        + “Looking for glXGetProcAddressEXT - not found”
        + Appears not to break script, no solution found.
    + linux/dependencies/el7.sh #yum install -y devtoolset-2-gcc-c++
        + missing libgmp.so.3 and libmpfr.so.1
        + yum install gmp-devel did not fix.
    + Open ISS Image Driver ./driver-test 
        + Missing the /dev/ISSIMAGEDRV 
        + Not able to fix with command line

Limitations
===========
+ Could not find a way to install libgmp.so.3 and libmpfr.so.1
