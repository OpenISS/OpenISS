# OpenISS

*Open Illimitable Space System*

OpenISS is inspired by its counterparts of ISS and ISSv2, but being built
from scratch using C and C++ and open-source libraries and toolkits for
sensors and creative coding. Various wrappers are being developed.
See background on the original ISS below.

## Build Instructions ##

### EL6 ###

Notice, EL6 requires a newer kernel for
proper USB3 and NVIDIA support. If you prefer
to install dependencies manually, you can follow
the scripts referenced here (`build.sh` and `el6.sh`) and repeat their
relevant steps one by one.

	Install:
			yum install git
			git clone https://github.com/OpenISS/OpenISS.git
			git submodule update --init --recursive
			Navigate to OpenISS/src
			Run the command:
				make deps

			This will install all of the 3rd party
			dependencies

	Compile:	
			cd OpenISS/src
			make

	Clean:		
			Navigate to OpenISS/src
			Run the command:
				make clean

			Removes the installed dependencies

## TODO ##

* See [issues](https://github.com/OpenISS/OpenISS/issues).

### Build Support ###

* OS X
* Windows

### Wrappers ###

* Java
* C++
* Processing
* Max
* Python
* ...

## Background on the original ISS ##

OpenISS’s core goals are to enable achieving something akin
to the original ISS below in an open educational setting. Then,
to build custom applications based on it.
