# OpenISS

*Open Illimitable Space System*

OpenISS is inspired by the development of ISSv1, ISSv2, and MultiCamTk++, but is being built
from scratch using C and C++ and similar or same open-source libraries and toolkits for
sensors and creative coding. Various wrappers are being developed. See background on the inspirational ISS below.
OpenISS API is likewise for the first time made it possble to access Kinect 1 and 2
as well as OpenCV as REST and SOAP services for creative near-realtime online broadcasting.
OpenISS is poised to be the core replacement for ISSv2's pipeline. It also serves as
an educational tool for graduate and undergraduate students in computer vision, computation
arts, pattern recognition, AI, machine learning, and game development. It is designed
to be portable.

OpenISS component development began in 2016 in C.

## Build Instructions ##

### EL7 ###

EL7 (RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux) are as of September 2018 default and
preferred build, so the development effort focuses around this platform,
but it is known to run on macOS and Ubuntu.

### EL6 ###

EL6 is now considered legacy.

Notice, EL6 requires a newer kernel for
proper USB3 and NVIDIA support. If you prefer
to install dependencies manually, you can follow
the scripts referenced here (`build.sh` and `el6.sh`) and repeat their
relevant steps one by one.

	Install:
			yum install git
			git clone https://github.com/OpenISS/OpenISS.git
			git submodule update --init --recursive
			Navigate to OpenISS/src
			Run the command:
				make deps

			This will install all of the 3rd party
			dependencies

	Compile:	
			cd OpenISS/src
			make

	Clean:		
			Navigate to OpenISS/src
			Run the command:
				make clean

			Removes the installed dependencies

## TODO ##

* See [issues](https://github.com/OpenISS/OpenISS/issues).

### Build Support ###

* OS X
* Windows

### Wrappers ###

* Java
* C++
* Processing
* Max
* Python
* ...

## Background on the ISSv1, ISSv2, ISSv3 ##

OpenISS’s core goals are to enable achieving something akin
to the original ISS below in an open educational setting. Then,
to build custom applications based on it, using OpenISS API
as a core.
